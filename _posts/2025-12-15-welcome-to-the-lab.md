Welcome!

I don’t know how you ended up on this blog. Maybe a switch just melted down at 2 a.m. Maybe your “simple” change window spawned 400 syslog errors. Maybe you just typed a command you deeply regret.

What I do have is an unreasonably specific set of skills—collected over years of building, breaking, and then automating networks back into submission. Not movie-level skills, mind you. More the “make your config actually deploy correctly the first time” kind of skills. The kind of skills that turn 7,500 hours of manual work into a button click and a quiet night.

This blog is my way of using those skills for good: sharing the playbooks, tools, and war stories I wish someone had handed me when I was staring at my first router prompt wondering what would explode if I hit Enter.

If you’re new and trying to figure out where to start, or you’ve been around long enough to know how much you don’t know, you’re in the right place. We’ll walk through real code, real networks, and real mistakes—with enough humor to make the logs hurt a little less.

Stay tuned.
