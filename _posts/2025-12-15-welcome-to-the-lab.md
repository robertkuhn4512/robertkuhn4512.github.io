This is a lightweight log of the systems I'm building and operating:

- **FastAPI backend** that talks to network devices and various databases
- **Vault** and **Keycloak** for secrets and auth
- **MariaDB/PostgreSQL** for storing telemetry, discovery, and reporting data

Future posts will cover things like:

- Designing a FastAPI backend for network discovery and IP/ARP reporting
- Structuring Vault policies and AppRoles for internal tools
- CI/CD patterns for pushing changes safely into production networks
- “It broke in the middle of the night” stories and how we fixed them

Stay tuned.
