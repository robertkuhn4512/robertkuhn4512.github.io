# About

# About

I’m a senior network and automation engineer turned network-focused software developer, 
with 10+ years of experience designing, operating, and automating large-scale IP networks. 
My background is equal parts routing/switching and building the tooling that keeps those environments observable, compliant, and maintainable.

Over the last several years I’ve moved from “just” configuring devices into building full-stack internal platforms: multi-server, multi-cluster systems that handle device discovery, configuration generation, backups, inventory, impact reporting, and software lifecycle at scale. 
A lot of that work has involved Python, templating engines (Jinja/Jinja2/Twig), and live network data to safely push changes across many nodes while minimizing risk and human error.

Professionally, my current focus areas include (but are not limited to):

- **Network automation and tooling** – device discovery, configuration compliance, backups, inventory, and impact analysis  
- **Python / FastAPI backends** – building APIs and services behind internal network tools platforms  
- **Infrastructure components** – Vault, Keycloak, MariaDB/PostgreSQL, and related security/identity layers  
- **Containerized deployments** – Docker-based environments for development, testing, and production automation services

Personally, my current focus areas include (but are not limited to):

- **3D Design and Printing** – using Fusion 360 and other CAD tools to design and model custom prints  
- **Electrical engineering projects** – revisiting my original interest in electrical engineering and diving deeper into home automation projects tailored around my printing setup as well as my love of flying RC Quad copters.
- **Family time (The best time!)** – spending time with my wife and kids, introducing them to these hobbies and others (and a bit of programming) to see what sparks their interest, while also supporting their own activities and interests

## Why this blog exists

This blog is about passing on information to people who are just getting started, as well as those who have been in the field for a while and want to learn something new or collaborate and network in networking and network-focused software development or any of the personal hobbies listed above.

The technical side of this blog is meant for anyone who has looked at automation, APIs, or “network tools” and thought:

> “I’d love to do that, but I have no idea where to start.”

Here you’ll find:

- Gentle, practical introductions to concepts I use day-to-day  
- Real-world examples instead of only textbook diagrams  
- Honest notes on what worked (for me), what didn’t, and what I’d do differently next time  

I’ve been fortunate to learn from a lot of generous engineers and mentors over the years. This site is my way of **paying that forward**—sharing the knowledge, patterns, and hard-earned lessons I was given, so the next person has a clearer path than I did.

If you’re starting out and something here helps you move one step further, then this blog is doing its job. If you’re further along and want to compare notes or offer improvements, feel free to open an issue or PR on this repo.

This blog is a new (as of 12/16/2025) collection of tools that I’m building on the latest versions of the software I work with (Python, PHP, SQL and the likes).
Each section of the blog links directly to a specific part of the repo and the corresponding lesson in the README, so you can move between explanation and code with as little friction as possible.
