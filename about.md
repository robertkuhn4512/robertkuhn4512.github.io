# About

# About

I’m a senior network and automation engineer turned network-focused software developer, with 10+ years of experience designing, operating, and automating large-scale IP networks. My background is equal parts routing/switching and building the tooling that keeps those environments observable, compliant, and maintainable.

Over the last several years I’ve moved from “just” configuring devices into building full-stack internal platforms: multi-server, multi-cluster systems that handle device discovery, configuration generation, backups, inventory, impact reporting, and software lifecycle at scale. A lot of that work has involved Python, templating engines (Jinja/Jinja2/Twig), and live network data to safely push changes across many nodes while minimizing risk and human error.

These days my focus is on:

- **Network automation and tooling** – device discovery, config compliance, backups, inventory, and impact analysis  
- **Python / FastAPI backends** – building APIs and services behind internal network tools platforms  
- **Infrastructure components** – Vault, Keycloak, MariaDB/PostgreSQL, and related security/identity layers  
- **Git-first workflows and CI/CD** – treating network and infra changes like software, with review, testing, and automated deployment  
- **Containerized deployments** – Docker-based environments for dev, test, and production automation services

## Why this blog exists

This blog is about **passing on information to people who are just getting started** in networking and network-focused software development.

It’s meant for anyone who has looked at automation, APIs, or “network tools” and thought:

> “I’d love to do that, but I have no idea where to start.”

Here you’ll find:

- Gentle, practical introductions to concepts I use day-to-day  
- Real-world examples instead of only textbook diagrams  
- Honest notes on what worked, what didn’t, and what I’d do differently next time  

I’ve been fortunate to learn from a lot of generous engineers and mentors over the years. This site is my way of **paying that forward**—sharing the knowledge, patterns, and hard-earned lessons I was given, so the next person has a clearer path than I did.

If you’re starting out and something here helps you move one step further, then this blog is doing its job. If you’re further along and want to compare notes or offer improvements, feel free to open an issue or PR on this repo.
