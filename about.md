# About

I’m a network-focused software developer working on:

- Network automation and tooling (device discovery, config compliance, reporting)
- Python / FastAPI backends for internal tools
- Infrastructure pieces like Vault, Keycloak, and MariaDB/PostgreSQL
- Git-first workflows, CI/CD, and containerized deployments

This blog is mostly:

- Architecture notes
- “What I wish I had written down six months ago”
- Practical examples and incident postmortems

If you’re doing similar work and want to compare notes, feel free to open an issue or PR on this repo.
